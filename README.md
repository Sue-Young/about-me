It took longer than I thought.  I knew what I wanted to do.  And then I didn't build it slowly.  I went for the end game fast because I was worried I was behind.  Bad idea.  I usually develop very incrementally.  I am finding this is even more important in a scripting language, as the debugging tools are very limited. But still fun!  Proud of it!
