I added the ul, ol, header styling as part of this lab because the page was a mess. 

## Lab 03
Adding the top ten list, sixth and seventh questions. No functions!

It took longer than I thought.  I knew what I wanted to do.  And then I didn't build it slowly.  I went for the end game fast because I was worried I was behind.  Bad idea.  I usually develop very incrementally.  I am finding this is even more important in a scripting language, as the debugging tools are very limited. But still fun!  Proud of it! 

## Lab 04
Added the function and a for loop for the questions

This one went faster than I thought. Much faster than Lab 03.  I was granted the boon to work alone so I could catch-up as I was behind a day's assignments.  I will go do the other pieces I missed beyond the labs now.  I find the labs the most beneficial and I've been learning a lot through them. Oh, and I have a quiz to take!
